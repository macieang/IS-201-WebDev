                        <p>When my parents were engaged, my mom had a sacred experience involving me. She learned my name, that I was a leader, and that I would come to our family. One and a half years later I was born and named Macie Ann, bearing the names of two amazing grandmothers. I’ve strived to live my life to honor them. Being a leader came naturally - as the oldest of 8 kids I’ve tried to set an example of excellence! Born in Provo, I quickly learned to love BYU. As a toddler, my dad (former captain of the cheer squad) taught me the BYU fight song. When I was just one I won the BYU baby contest (I’m still BYU’s #1 cheerleader)! As I grew, I realized why we loved BYU – because it’s the Lord’s school. BYU’s mission -- "to assist individuals in their quest for perfection and eternal life" – is the same as my family mission. The gospel of Jesus Christ has always been paramount in my life, and I strive for perfection as I try to emulate the Savior.</p>
                        <p>At a very young age it also became clear that I had passion for dance – I started classes when I was just three. This love of dance only continued to grow. Training with the nationally acclaimed Center Stage and Aspire Dance, I danced competitively for 11 years – starting with 5 hours of practice per week in pre-K to eventually 40 hours a week in high school.  My goal was to become a BYU Cougarette. Meanwhile, I was also striving for academic excellence. As a student in the inaugural Chinese Immersion program at Wasatch, I became fluent in Mandarin. I love Chinese – it’s part of who I am. In addition, I discovered that I have a passion for reading and learning EVERYTHING! In high school I filled my schedule with as many AP classes as I could (IS classes too!). Dancing 40 hours a week coupled with rigorous academics took its toll – freshman year I averaged 4 hours of sleep each night. I re-evaluated my life and priorities. Was I spending my time in alignment with what mattered most? After years of sacrificing for dance I recognized that I lacked balance. In a heart-breaking decision, I chose to give up my Cougarette dream in order to realize better dreams. Many blessings came from this difficult decision. I now had more time to study the gospel and serve as Laurel class president. The work ethic and organization I’d learned dancing were assets in academics and athletics. I joined the cheer squad and made a positive impact - as cheer team captain I had incredible opportunities to lead and influence. At home, I became the sister I’d always wanted to be. In 2019 my mom was diagnosed with cancer and I became a second mother to my 7 siblings while she underwent treatment. Although it was very difficult, I maintained a HS 4.0 while captaining Varsity cheer and serving my family. This freshman year at BYU I’ve continued to work hard, dedicating myself to learning and excellence in challenging classes. I’ve made many lifelong friends and grown spiritually – and that growth has enabled me to better serve others!</p>
                        <p>I was called to serve a mission for the Chruch of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in Oakland California, speaking mandarin, with a primiary assignment to serve in the Oakland Temple Visitors Center. I loved every second of my mission and was able to grow and learn much as I served and worshipped with the Chinese community in the Bay Area. I am now home from my mission and teach Mandarin at the MTC. I love working with the Lord's called and set apart servants! I'm a pre business major, and I'm not entirely sure what I want to study just yet, but I do know that the Lord has a plan for me and he will guide me to do what is right with my life!</p>
